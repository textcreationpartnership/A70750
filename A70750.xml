            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is now, I think, more than a year ſince I firſt ſaw a little BOOK written by way of Letter, called, <hi>Obſervations and Reflections on my Lord of</hi> Caſtle-Haven's <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires:</hi> Wherein, though there are ſome things that might lead the Reader to believe that your Lordſhip was the AUTHOR; yet there were many more. I thought impoſſible ſhould come from you: For it affirms many Matters of Fact poſitively, which are eaſily and authentically to be diſproved: And from thoſe Matters of Fact, groſly miſtaken, it deduces Conſequences, raiſes Inferences, and ſcatters Glances injurious to the memory of the Dead, and the Honour of ſome Living: Among thoſe that by the Bleſſing of God are yet living, I find my ſelf worſt Treated; Twenty years after the Kings Reſtauration, and Forty after the beginning of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, as if it had been all that while reſerved for me, and for ſuch Times as theſe we are fallen into, when Calumny, (though the Matter of it be never ſo groundleſs and improbable,) meets with Credulity; and when Liberty is taken to aſperſe Men, and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the World under the monſtrous and odious Figures of Papiſts, or Popiſhly affected: Not becauſe they are ſo thought by thoſe that employ the Repreſenters, but, becauſe they are known to be too good Proteſtants, and too Loyal Subjects, to joyn in the Deſtruction of the Crown and Church: Beſides, the Treatiſe came forth, and muſt have been written, when I had but newly received Repeated Aſſurances of the continuance of your Friendſhip to me, wherein, as in one of your Letters, you are pleaſed to ſay, you had never made a falſe ſtep; for theſe Reaſons I was not willing to believe that Book to be of your Lordſhips Compoſing, and hoped ſome of the Suborned Libellers of the Age had endeavoured to Imitate your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and not you them; but I was in a while after, firſt by my Son

               <hi>Arran,</hi> and afterwards by the Bearer, Sir <hi>Robert Reading,</hi> aſſured your Lordſhip had owned to them that the Piece was yours, but profeſt the Publication to be without your Order, and that you did not intend to do, or think that you had done me any injury or prejudice: If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip really thought ſo, the Publication might have been owned as well as what was Publiſhed: But then let the World Judge, whether Pen, Ink, and Paper are not dangerous Tools in your Hands? When I was thus aſſured your Lordſhip was the Author, it coſt me ſome thoughts how to vindicate Truth, my Maſter the late King, my ſelf, my Actions and Family, all Reflected on, and traduced by that Pamphlet; I found my ſelf ingaged in the Service of our preſent King, and that in a Time of difficulty and danger, and in ſuch Times for the moſt part it has been my lot to be Employed in Publick Affairs; and though I had not been ſo taken up, yet I well knew that Writing upon ſuch Occaſions is no more my Talent, than it is my Delight: And to ſay truth, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to the exerciſe might help to perſwade me, that the Book, though honoured with your Lordſhips Name, would, after it had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed its Office in <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> and ſerved your Lordſhips Deſign in that Conjuncture, expire; as Writings of that nature and force uſually do: And herein I reſted, without troubling my ſelf, or any body elſe, with Animadverſions upon your Lordſhips miſtakes, which are ſo many, and ſo obvious, that I wonder how you could fall into them. I will add to this, that I have been in expectation that by this time your Compleat Hiſtory would have come forth, wherein, if I may judge by the Pattern, I have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that neither the Subject or my ſelf will be more juſtly dealt with, than in that occaſional Eſſay, and I would have been glad to have ſeen all my Work before me, in caſe I ſhould think fit to make a Work of it. The delay of your Publiſhing that Hiſtory, and the conſideration of your Lordſhips Age and mine, are the occaſions of this Letter, whereby I inform you, that as no man now alive is better able than I am to give an account of the Principal Tranſactions during the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo no man is poſſeſſed of more Authentick Commiſſions, Inſtruments, and Papers; all which, or Tranſcripts of them, you might have Commanded, before you ſet forth your Reflections: But poſſibly to have ſtayed for them, might have loſt you a ſeaſonable opportunity of Publiſhing your abhorrence of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, and your Zeal againſt Popery: What your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might then have had, you may yet have, becauſe I had rather help to prevent than detect Errours, but then I muſt firſt know to what particular part of your Hiſtory you deſire Information, and how you deliver thoſe parts to the World and to Poſterity. If after this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your Lordſhip ſhall proceed to the Concluſion and Publication of your Hiſtory, and not accept of it, I muſt before-hand Appeal from you, as from an Incompetent Judge of my Actions, and a partially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and an unfaithful Hiſtorian.</p>
